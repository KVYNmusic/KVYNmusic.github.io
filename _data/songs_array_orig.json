No, no \nAnd I won't run for my life \nShe's got, her jaws now, locked down in a smile \nBut nothing is alright, alright \n\nAnd I want something else, to get me through this life \nBaby, I want something else. Not listening when you say... \nGood-bye, good-bye, good-bye, good-bye \n\nDoo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo... \n\nThe sky was gold, it was rose (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...) \nI was taking sips of it through my nose (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...) \nAnd I wish I could get back there (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...) \nSomeplace back there, in the place we used to start (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...) \n\nI want something else (Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...)

Your sex is on fire \n\n[Verse 2]\nThe dark of the alley, The break of the day \nHead while I'm driving, I'm driving \nSoft lips are open, Them knuckles are pale \nFeels like you're dying, You're dying \n\n[Chorus]\nYou... Your sex is on fire \nConsumed... With what's to transpire\n\n[Verse 3]\nHot as a fever, Rattling bones \nI could just taste it, Taste it \nBut it's not forever, But it's just tonight \nOh we're still the greatest, \nThe greatest, the greatest\n\n[Chorus]\nYou... your sex is on fire \n\n[Bridge]\nYou... Your sex is on fire \nConsumed... With what's just transpired \n\n[Chorus]\nAnd You... Your sex is on fire \nConsumed... With what's just transpired\nOohh",

[3x]\n\nWay out in the water\nSee it swimmin'\n\nI was swimmin' in the Caribbean\nAnimals were hiding behind the rock\nExcept the little fish\nBut they told me, he swears\nTryin' to talk to me, to me, to me.\n\nWhere is my mind? [3x]\n\nWay out in the water\nSee it swimmin'\n\nWith your feet on the air and your head on the ground\nTry this trick and spin it, yeah\nYour head will collapse\nIf there's nothing in it\nAnd you'll ask yourself\n\nWhere is my mind? [3x]\n\nWay out in the water\nSee it swimmin'\n\nOh\nWith your feet on the air and your head on the ground\nOh\nTry this trick and spin it, yeah\nOh\nOh\n",
